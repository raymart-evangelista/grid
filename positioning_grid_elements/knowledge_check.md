- Explain the difference between a track and a line.
  - gird lines are only created implicitly after our grid tracks have been defined-- we can't explicitly create grid lines--we can only explicitly create grid tracks

- What is the smallest unit on a grid?
  - a cell which is what each child element of a grid container will occupy by default

- What kind of value do we give the grid-column-start or grid-column-end properties?
  - we give these properties the start and end grid lines for where a grid child element should be between

- Which property can we use to combine all the start and end values for a grid item?
  - grid-area is used to combine row-start / col-start / row-end / col-end properties

- Which grid container property can map out a visual structure of grid items?
  - grid-template-areas is the property that can be used to visually structure grid items
